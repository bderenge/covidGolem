## Hello! 

Welcome to covidGolem. 

This project started out as my exploration on the differences of writing a native Shiny app versus a golem Shiny app, however it also serves the purpose of provides a way for users to track the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the United States. 

After completing the base app, the rest of my team at Ge labs (SDSU) have been using this app as an exercise on working collaboratively on GitHub. 

*Note: This app was created as part of my work as a graduate research assistant.*
