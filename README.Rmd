## Hello! 

Welcome to covidGolem. 

This project started out as my exploration on the differences of writing a native Shiny app versus a golem Shiny app. 

After completing the base app, the rest of my team at Ge labs (SDSU) have been using this app as an exercise on working collaboratively on GitHub.
