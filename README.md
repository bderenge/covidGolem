## Hello!

Welcome to covidGolem.

This project started out as my exploration on the differences of writing
a native Shiny app versus a golem Shiny app.

After completing the base app, the rest of my team at Ge labs (SDSU)
have been using this app as an exercise on working collaboratively on
GitHub.
